max{0, d + g(H - h1)}

That's the formula the bus uses to determine how long to wait at a control point.

d = 
d > is the average delay at equalibrium
tested in chicago to be 5.8 minutes - or approximately half of a natural headway

hn = 
distance to trailing bus & average velocity
hn = d / s = distance / average speed

H = 
target headway 

h1 = 
forward headway of the arriving bus

g = 
control parameter 
> 0

Best performing for Chicogo Bus route: 

d = 5.8
g = 0.8
h = 7


Some details about another bus line for reference:

Scheduled time: 
eastbound: 75 minutes
westbound: 65 minutes
65 + 75 = 140 minutes

Rountrip time / number of busses = natural headway ~ scheduled headway

140 / 22 = 6.36 ~ 7 which is the scheduled headway

Self equalizing headway control: 

beta = 6.0 minutes
alpha = 0.55
